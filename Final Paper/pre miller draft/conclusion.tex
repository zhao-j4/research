\begin{conjecture}
    Iterating, that is, fix $\phi_1$ solve for $\phi_2$, fix $\phi_2$ solve for $\phi_3$, etc., converges to the global/local minimum. 
\end{conjecture}

Comparing with brute force might give some insight whether this conjecture is true or not. Strong version is global minimum, weak version is local minimum.
